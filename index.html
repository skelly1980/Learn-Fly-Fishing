						<h3>Casting</h3>
						<div class="casting video">

								width="300"
								height="215"
								src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/oDJJ6W23gHw"

								Peter Kutzer form the Orvis company explains how to make the
								basic cast with a fly rod. This is the foundation of how
								everyone who has ever casted a fly rod has learned to cast.
								Peter is an excellent teacher and this is in my opinion the
								simplest explanation of how to cast a fly rod that I have seen.
								Pay close attention to how he explains the rod needing to stop
								abruptly and the fly line straightening out behind you before
								making the forward cast. That is the most important part of
								learning to cast a fly rod. Making sure that the rod tip travels
								in a straight path is the next important part of this video. A
								straight path will produce a smooth and accurate cast. One thing
								that I would add is something that Peter touches on a bit but I
								would expand further on is using just the wrist when first
								learning to cast. Lock your elbow to your side and snap your
								wrist back hard and stop ot abruptly. After waiting about a
								second you can snap your wrist forward hard to get the cast to
								lay out in front of you.

						<h3>Rigging</h3>

								height="215"

							<p>
								Something that isn't often explained to most people when
								beginning to fly fish is how to rig up your fly rod set up. When
								rigging up your fly rod there actually is a right way and wrong
								way to do it. Twisting and lining up the dots when putting the
								sections together is very important. Done incorrectly, the
								section will actually seperate on you when casting or worse they
								can break. I'm not a very tall person like Peter is so I put the
								bottom two section together, then the top two sections, and
								finally I put the whole rod together. Peter does mention a very
								important tip about putting a hat down on the ground to protect
								your reel when stringing the line up through the rod. Folding
								the flyline over when strining up your rod is an excellent tip
								and will save you a lot of headaches.

						<h3>Flies</h3>

							<p>
								Choosing flies tends to be the most intimidating part of fly
								fishing to most beginners. They see how many different types of
								flies that are available and it can seem daunting to choose.
								This is actually not the case at all. Generally speaking twelve
								or so flies is about all you'll ever need to get yourself
								started. There are three types of flies dry flies, nymphs,and
								streamers. The first type is the only that actually requires a
								little bit of thought but the other two you can just pick one.
								There is no right or wrong when it comes to using a nymph or
								streamer. Dry flies can be simplified into two seperate
								catagories when it comes to how to choose one. The first and
								most important is the color. To simplify this even further all
								you need to do is observe the color of the color of the bugs or
								insects flying around the stream or river you are on and pick
								one that most closely matches there color. the next important
								element is the size and this is even simpler. Justt pick a size
								you believe to be closest and goahead and use it. If your not
								catching any fish on it got to a smaller sized fly. Don't waste
								your time thinking youneed to know the names of all the flies
								inorder to catch fish with them. You don't, you'll learn the
								names over time.

							This page will explain some very simple and easy ways to get
							yourself out fishing once you learn how to cast. I will make some
							recomendations on some ways to get out and have some fun while
							avoiding any type of frustrations you may encounter. When most
							people think about fly fishing they tend to envision a picturesque
							river somewhere in the middle of no where. This is not the best
							way to get started. Your local parks and town ponds have plenty of
							easy to catch fish for you to hone yor skills on before proceeding
							to a more technical style that most trout fishing requires.

							This page will give recommendations on the type of gear that will
							be required for anyone to get started in fly fishing. The focus of
							this page is the minimum amount of gear you need to get started
							fly fishing. I will give recommendations across the budget range
							and give brief descriptions of the differences. Keep in my that
							any of these suggestions will work, the budget part is completely
							up to the person.
